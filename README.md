# Stephen Kurshner's Portfolio

This is my portfolio website for the HTML/CSS module of my Thinkful Engineering Flex course. I created an inital design in Figma and rebuilt it using skills I learned both in the course as well as outside. The site is not fully responsive yet and doesn't contain any projects. But I think it is a great start and a solid foundation to build upon.
